üßµ Thread: "I built an AI that reads your mood and finds perfect songs. Here's what happened when I tested it..."

1/ Ever spend 20 minutes looking for the "right" song for your mood? 
I got tired of this, so I built an AI to solve it.

2/ Here's how it works: You describe your mood in plain English, 
and the AI analyzes emotional patterns in music to find perfect matches.

3/ I tested it with "feeling nostalgic about college days"
The AI recommended [specific song]. I literally got chills. 
It understood the exact vibe I was going for.

4/ Then I tried "need energy for a workout but not too aggressive"
Perfect recommendation again. This thing is reading my mind.

5/ The best part? It's completely free. No ads, no premium features.
Just pure AI-powered music discovery.
